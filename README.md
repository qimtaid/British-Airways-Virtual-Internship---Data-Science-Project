# British Airways Virtual Internship - Data Science Project

This repository contains the deliverables for the **British Airways Virtual Internship** offered through **Forage**. The virtual internship focuses on applying **Data Science** techniques such as web scraping, sentiment analysis, and classification modeling to solve real-world problems encountered by British Airways.

## Overview
The project consists of two main tasks:

### Task 1: Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze customer reviews from [AirlineQuality](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways) using sentiment analysis techniques.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Web Scraping**: Extract unstructured data (customer reviews) from the Airline Quality website using web scraping techniques.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Apply sentiment analysis to classify the reviews into positive and negative categories based on the tone of the feedback.
3. **Presentation**: Prepare a PowerPoint presentation that highlights insights from the analysis, including a breakdown of positive vs negative reviews, common themes, and recommendations for improvement.

### Task 2: Customer Behavior Classification Model
- **Objective**: Build a classification model to predict customer buying behavior using historical data.
  

#### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. **Modeling**: Use machine learning algorithms to create a classification model that predicts customer buying behavior based on input features.
3. **Insights and Reporting**: Develop a PowerPoint presentation to showcase the model's performance, key insights, and recommendations for British Airways based on the analysis.
